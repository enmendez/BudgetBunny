# BudgetBunny 🥕
*Hopping towards a brighter future!*

## Inspiration
Budgeting can be daunting. According to [Debt.org](https://www.debt.org/faqs/americans-in-debt/demographics/), 90% of Americans have some form of debt. Despite the impact income has on livelihood and mental well-being, many people struggle to manage their finances well. Therefore raising awareness about financial literacy and responsible financial decisions is imperative.


## What It Does
We created BudgetBunny--an interactive, budget-tracking and saving app. Users are incentivied to save portions of their income as they gain experience points
to level-up their cute bunny avatar. 

## How We Built It
For backend, we used Django and Python. We used Django to process user requests and interact with a Neon Tech database.
Python was used for the main menu option and receiving user input. HTML, CSS, and Javascript was used for the frontend.

## Challenges We Faced
One of our main challenges was being overly ambitious. A good portion of our time was spent trying to connect bank account to our website
to collect user data in real time. Additionally, we had issues with the server and the CSS files we use to style each webpage.
Getting used to Github and downloading the frameworks we needed on the terminal proved to be challenging as well.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
This was the first hackathon experience for most of our group members, and it was the first time
all of us had to work within a group to create a coding project. We had a short amount of time to learn 
what we wanted to do and how to code it, and we were able to pish through despite all that! We
had so many creative ideas we explored, and we were adventerous with every challenge. A lot
of us met for the first time at Pearl Hacks, and we worked collaboratively and encouraged each other.


## What We Learned
The biggest lesson we learned was about working as a team. We all had different assets and skills, and it was
amazing to see how we could work together to create a project we cared deeply for. Working with other people
required us to check in on each other and communicate frequently, especially as we stayed overnight in different places.
Finally, we learned about endurance and pushing through until the end!
